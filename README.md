# ⚔ adblock-lean

adblock-lean is a low maintenance (almost set and forget), powerful and ultra-efficient adblocking solution for OpenWrt that **does not mandate any external dependencies** or introduce unecessary bloat. It is  **highly optimized for RAM & CPU efficiency** during blocklist download & processing, and does not remain running in memory after execution.  adblock-lean is designed to leverage the [major rewrite of the DNS server and domain handling code](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/CHANGELOG) associated with dnsmasq 2.86, which drastically improves dnsmasq performance and reduces memory footprint. This **facilitates the use of very large blocklists even for low spec, low performance devices.**

If you like adblock-lean and can benefit from it, then please leave a ⭐ (top right) and become a [stargazer](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean/stargazers)! And feel free to post any feedback on the official OpenWrt thread [here](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/adblock-lean-set-up-adblock-using-dnsmasq-blocklist/157076). Thank you for your support.

## Features

adblock-lean includes the following features:

- supports multiple blocklist files downloaded from user-specified urls
- supports local blocklist
- supports multiple allowlist files downloaded from user-specified urls
- supports local allowlist
- supports blocklist compression (which significantly reduces memory consumption) by leveraging the new conf-script functionality of dnsmasq
- removal of domains found in the allowlist from the blocklist files
- combining all downloaded and local lists into one final blocklist file
- check that each individual blocklist and allowlist file does not exceed configurable maximum size
- check that the total blocklist size does not exceeed configurable maximum file size
- check for rogue entries in blocklist file parts (e.g. check for redirection to specific IP)
- check that line count in blocklist file exceeds configurable minimum (default: 100,000)
- save a compressed copy of the previous blocklist file, then load the new combined blocklist file into dnsmasq
- perform checks on restarted dnsmasq with new blocklist file
- revert to previous blocklist file if checks fail
- if checks on previous blocklist file also fail then revert to not using any blocklist file
- implements optional calls to user-configurable script on success or failure (for example to send an email report)
- automatically check for application updates and self update functionality
- config keys and values validation and optional automatic config repair when problems are detected
- automated interactive setup

## Installation on OpenWrt

Connect to your OpenWrt router [via SSH](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-quick-start/sshadministration) and then follow the guide below.

To download and install adblock-lean, use the following commands:
```bash
uclient-fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean/master/abl-install.sh -O /tmp/abl-install.sh
sh /tmp/abl-install.sh
```

adblock-lean includes automated interactive setup which makes it easy to get going. If you prefer manual setup, skip the following section.

### Automated interactive setup
When the installation is completed, the install script will suggest to launch automated setup. If for some reason you did not accept that suggestion, you can start automated setup with this command:
```bash
sh /etc/init.d/adblock-lean setup
```

This will ask you several questions and make all important changes automatically, based on your replies.

### Manual setup
If you prefer to set up adblock-lean manually (after successful installation), use following commands:
```bash
chmod +x /etc/init.d/adblock-lean # Makes the script executable
service adblock-lean gen_config   # Generates default config in /root/adblock-lean/config and sets up blocklist updates

# This will allow adblock-lean to automatically run on boot
service adblock-lean enable

# Optional/recommended. Makes list processing significantly faster (doesn't affect DNS resolution speed). gawk including dependencies may consume around 1MB. If flash space is an issue, consider skipping gawk installation.
opkg update
opkg install gawk sed coreutils-sort
```

The above command `service adblock-lean gen_config` should have automatically determined the dnsmasq instance to attach to, or asked you which instance you prefer (in case you have multiple instances). So unless you have a really good reason, ignore the following section.

_<details><summary>If you need to manually configure the dnsmasq instance adblock-lean attaches to </summary>_

1) Check which `config dnsmasq` sections are defined in `/etc/config/dhcp`.
2) If only one `config dnsmasq` section exists then you are only running 1 dnsmasq instance. Note and write down: instance index is 0; instance name (it's either `cfg01411c` if the name is not specified or the optional word right after `config dnsmasq`); if `option confdir` is set, note and write down the value. If it is not set then the default conf-dir is `/tmp/dnsmasq.cfg01411c.d` in OpenWrt 24.10 and later (including current snapshots), or `/tmp/dnsmasq.d` in older OpenWrt versions.
3) If you have multiple `config dnsmasq` sections then multiple dnsmasq instances are running on your device. Then you should know which dnsmasq instance you want adblocking to work on. Use the command `/etc/init.d/dnsmasq info` to get a list of all running instances as json. Find the relevant dnsmasq instance. Note: instance index (1st instance has index 0, further instances increment the index by 1); instance name (example: `cfg01411c`); which network interfaces the relevant instance serves (likely listed in the 'netdev' section). In the `"command"` section of the json, look for a path in `/var/etc/`, write down the path. Check the contents of the file at that path and look for `conf_dir=`. This is the conf-dir this instance is using - note and write it down.
4) In the adblock-lean config file: specify instance name in option `DNSMASQ_INSTANCE` (example: `DNSMASQ_INSTANCE="cfg01411c"`); specify instance index in option `DNSMASQ_INDEX` (example: `DNSMASQ_INDEX="0"`), specify instance conf-dir in option `DNSMASQ_CONF_D` (example: `DNSMASQ_CONF_D="/tmp/dnsmasq.d"`).

</details>

Optional/recommended: enable blocklist compression to reduce RAM usage. To achieve this, add the line
```
	list addnmount '/bin/busybox'
```
to the relevant dnsmasq section (under `config dnsmasq`) of file `/etc/config/dhcp`. If using a compression utility other than the built-in Busybox gzip, add a second addnmount line with the path to its executable file.

If only one `config dnsmasq` section exists then that's the section to add the line to. If you have multiple `config dnsmasq` sections, this means that multiple dnsmasq instances are running on your device. Then you should know which dnsmasq instance you want adblocking to work on - add the line to that section. Verify that same dnsmasq instance index is configured in `/etc/adblock-lean/config` (1st instance corresponds to the 1st `config dnsmasq` section and has index 0, further instances increment the index by 1).

Now run the command `service dnsmasq restart`.

## Usage

adblock-lean is written as a service and `service adblock-lean start` will process any local blocklist/allowlist, download blocklist/allowlist parts, generate a new merged blocklist file and set up dnsmasq with it. Various checks are performed and, depending on the outcome of those checks, the script will either: accept the new blocklist file; reject the blocklist file if it didn't pass the checks and fallback to a previous blocklist file if available; or as a last resort restart dnsmasq with no blocklist file.

Additional available commands:
- `version`: prints adblock-lean version
- `stop`: stops any running adblock-lean instances, unloads the blocklist and removes it from memory
- `restart`: runs the `stop`, then `start` commands
- `pause`: unloads the blocklist and creates a compressed copy of it
- `resume`: decompresses the blocklist and loads it into dnsmasq
- `update`: pulls an update for adblock-lean from Github (if available) and installs the updated version
- `uninstall`: removes the adblock-lean service and optionally adblock-lean settings, and undoes any other changes adblock-lean made to the system
- `gen_config`: generates default config based on one of the pre-defined presets
- `setup`: runs automated setup for adblock-lean
- `status`: checks dnsmasq and entries count of the active blocklist.
            If adblock-lean is doing something in the background, `status` will print which operation is currently performed.
- `gen_stats`: generates dnsmasq stats (prints to system log)
- `print_log`: prints most recent session log
- `upd_cron_job`: creates cron job for adblock-lean with schedule set in the config option 'cron_schedule'.
                  if config option set to 'disable', removes existing cron job if any
- `select_dnsmasq_instance`: analyzes dnsmasq instances and sets required options in the adblock-lean config

## Basic configuration
The config file for adblock-lean is located in `/etc/adblock-lean/config`.

A new compatible config can be generated automatically, which will overwrite the previous config fie:
```bash
service adblock-lean gen_config
```

The `setup` command is available after installation as well:
```bash
service adblock-lean setup # runs the interactive setup routine
```

For manual configuration, a text editor like nano or vi can be used to modify the config file:
```bash
opkg update
opkg install nano
nano /etc/adblock-lean/config
```

## Local Blocklist and Allowlist
adblock-lean supports the use of a local blocklist or allowlist to supplement and/or override the downloaded blocklists and allowlists. 

Simply add domains (e.g. example.com) seperated by newlines in `/etc/adblock-lean/blocklist` or `/etc/adblock-lean/allowlist` (these paths are configurable in the config). 

The following features are supported:

- allow a subdomain of a blocked domain;
- allow a perfectly matched domain from the blocklist; and 
- allow a higher level domain when subdomains are blocked (allow example.com when ads.example.com and tracking.example.com are in the blocklist).

### Automatic blocklist updates
Automatic blocklist updates can be enabled via a cron job. When enabled, adblock-lean will run according to schedule specified in the config file, with a delay of random number of minutes (0-60).

The random delay serves to prevent a thundering herd: from an altruistic perspective, amelioerate load on the blocklist server; and from a selfish perspective, increase the prospect that the server is not loaded during the download. 

To enable automatic blocklist updates or to change the update schedule, look for the option `cron_schedule=` in the config file and define your preferred cron schedule:
```
cron_schedule="<your_cron_schedule>"
```
Example: `cron_schedule="0 5 * * *"` for daily updates at 5 am

Currently adblock-lean does not validate the schedule you set in config, so make sure that your custom schedule complies to the crontab syntax.

To disable automatic blocklist updates, change the value for the `cron_schedule` option to `disable`:
```
cron_schedule="disable"
```

**Important:** After changing the schedule in the config, run the following command to have adblock-lean create/update/remove the cron job:
`service adblock-lean upd_cron_job`

## Supported formats

adblock-lean supports two blocklist/allowlist formats: **raw format** and **dnsmasq format**. Raw-format lists have the benefit of smaller file size dowload, improved processing speed and reduced ram usage. Hence built-in presets include lists in the raw format.

- [Visual example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/light-onlydomains.txt) of **raw-format list**
- [Visual example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/dnsmasq/light.txt) of **dnsmasq-formmat list**

## Adding new lists

The default [Hagezi lists](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists) are recommended to block as much as possible in respect of: _ads, affiliate, tracking, metrics, telemetry, fake, phishing, malware, scam, coins and other undesirable content_, all while breaking as few websites as possible. oisd lists are supported as well.

### Adding a new **Hagezi** list
1. Decide on the source list format first (**raw** or **dnsmasq**)
2. Add a **raw-formatted list** (recommended):
   - Use the **base download URL** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/`
   - Add the **list name** to the **base download URL**. The list name must have the **-onlydomains** suffix. View available list names [here](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/tree/main/wildcard).
   - The **complete download URL** should look similar to this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/popupads-onlydomains.txt`
3. **OR** add a **dnsmasq-formatted list**:
   - Use the **base download URL** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/dnsmasq/`
   - Add the **list name** to the **base download URL**. View available list names [here](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/tree/main/dnsmasq).
   - The **complete download URL** should look similar to this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/dnsmasq/popupads.txt`

### Adding a new **oisd** list
1. Decide on the source list format (**raw** or **dnsmasq**)
2. Visit the [oisd page](https://oisd.nl/setup/adblock-lean)
3. Add a **raw-formatted list** (recommended):
   - Look for URLs named **domainswild2** (note the **2**) and use any of them
4. **OR** add a **dnsmasq-formatted list**:
   - Look for URLs named **dnsmasq2** (note the **2**) and use any of them

### Adding another list
- Any other raw or dnsmasq format lists of your choice can be used, but make sure it conforms to [supported formats](#supported-formats).

## Advanced configuration

For devices with low memory capacity (less than 512MiB), the option `unload_blocklist_before_update`, when set to `auto`, will cause previous blocklist to be unloaded before downloading and processing a new one, in order to free up memory. For other cases of memory scarcity, consider setting this option to `1`.

### Selection of blocklists and associated parameters

An important factor in selecting blocklist(s) is how much free memory is available for blocklist use. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that there is sufficient free memory to prevent an out of memory situation.

The parameters described in the config section above relating to the intermediate sizes, blocklist line count and deduplication should be set according to the selected blocklists and available memory. These are considered self-explanatory, but if in any doubt please post on the OpenWrt thread at: 

https://forum.openwrt.org/t/adblock-lean-set-up-adblock-using-dnsmasq-blocklist/157076.

An excellent breakdown of highly suitable lists and their merits is provided at:

https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists

### Pre-defined presets

adblock-lean includes 5 pre-defined presets (mini, small, medium, large, large_relaxed), each one intended for devices with a certain total memory capacity. When running `adblock-lean setup` or `adblock-lean gen_config`, you can select one of these presets and have the corresponding config options automatically set.

When selecting a certain preset, the values for options `max_file_part_size_KB`, `max_blocklist_file_size_KB`, `min_good_line_count` are automatically calculated and written to the config file based on expected entries count.

The pre-defined presets (you can pick one when running `service adblock-lean gen_config` or `service adblock-lean setup`) are:

- **Mini**: for devices with 64MB of RAM. Aim for <100k entries. This preset includes circa 85k entries
```bash
blocklist_urls="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/pro.mini-onlydomains.txt"
```

- **Small**: for devices with 128MB of RAM. Aim for <300k entries. This preset includes circa 250k entries
```bash
blocklist_urls="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/pro-onlydomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/tif.mini-onlydomains.txt"
```

- **Medium**: for devices with 256MB of RAM. Aim for <600k entries. This preset includes circa 450k entries
```bash
blocklist_urls="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/pro-onlydomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/tif.medium-onlydomains.txt"
```

- **Large**: for devices with 512MB of RAM. This preset includes circa 1M entries
```bash
blocklist_urls="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/pro-onlydomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/tif-onlydomains.txt"
```
- **Large-Relaxed**: for devices with 1024MB of RAM or more. This preset includes circa 1M entries and same default blocklist URLs as 'Large' but the `max` values are more relaxed and allow for larger fluctuations in downloaded blocklist sizes.
```bash
blocklist_urls="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/pro-onlydomains.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/tif-onlydomains.txt"
```

### Blocklist compression
- By default, adblock-lean uses compression while processing downloaded blocklist/allowlist parts, and compresses the final blocklist before loading it into dnsmasq. This helps to reduce memory use.
- Supported compression utilities: Busybox gzip (every OpenWrt system has this built-in), GNU gzip, pigz and zstd. The latter 2 utilities support multithreaded compression.
- adblock-lean automatically sets parameters for any of the supported utilities for reasonable balance between speed and memory usage. You can specify your preferred compression utility in the `compression_util` option (default is `gzip`). You can also specify parameters to pass to the compression utility, separately for intermediate compression (`intermediate_compression_options`) and for the final blocklist compression (`final_compression_options`).
- Final blocklist compression depends on appropriate addnmount entries existing in `/etc/config/dhcp`. After changing the compression utility in the config file, make sure to run `service adblock-lean setup` in order to update the addnmount entries (answer `e` when asked whether to create new config or use existing config).

## Whitelist mode
This mode can be used to implement parental control or similar functionality while also adblocking inside the allowed domains. It can be enabled by setting the config option `whitelist_mode` to `1`. In this mode all domain names will be blocked, except for domains (and their subdomains) included in local and/or downloaded allowlists. In this mode, if blocklists are used in addition to allowlists, addresses which are included in the blocklists and which are subdomains of allowed domains - will be blocked as well.

For example, if the an allowlist has this entry: `google.com` and a blocklist has this entry: `ads.google.com`, and `whitelist_mode` is set to `1`, then `ads.google.com` will be blocked, while `google.com` and `mail.google.com` (and any other subdomain of `google.com` which is not included in the blocklist) will work.

Note that in this mode, the test domains (specified via the option `test_domains`) will be automatically added to the allowlist in order for the checks to pass. You can use empty string in that option - this will bypass that check and block the default domains (google.com, microsoft.com, amazon.com). Alternatively, you can specify preferred test domains instead of the default ones.

Also note that in this mode by default the Github domains will be blocked, so the automatic adblock-lean version update functionality will not work - unless you add `raw.githubusercontent.com` to the allowlist.

The resulting blocklist generated in whitelist mode will be typically much smaller than otherwise, so you may need to reduce the value of the `min_good_line_count` option in order for the list to be accepted by adblock-lean.

## User-configurable calls on success or failure

adblock-lean supports specifying a custom script which defines the functions `report_success`, `report_failure` and `report_update` to be called on success or failure, or when adblock-lean update is available (can be used to eg send an email/SMS/msg)

**Example below for free Brevo (formerly sendinblue) email service, but use your favourite smtp/email/SMS etc method.**

- Install mailsend package in OpenWRT
- Sign up for free Brevo account (not affiliated!) - provides 300 free email sends per day
- Edit your config file custom_script path.  Recommended path is '/usr/libexec/abl_custom-script.sh', which the adblock-lean luci app will have permission to access (for when the luci app is ready)
- Create file `/usr/libexec/abl_custom-script.sh` - specific user details (user variables in CAPITALS below):

```bash
#!/bin/sh

report_success()
{
mailbody="${1}"
mailsend -port 587 -smtp smtp-relay.brevo.com -auth -f FROM@EMAIL.COM -t TO@EMAIL.COM -user BREVO@USERNAME.COM -pass PASSWORD -sub "Adblock-lean blocklist update success" -M "${mailbody}"
}

report_failure()
{
mailbody="${1}"
mailsend -port 587 -smtp smtp-relay.brevo.com -auth -f FROM@EMAIL.COM -t TO@EMAIL.COM -user BREVO@USERNAME.COM -pass PASSWORD -sub "Adblock-lean blocklist update failed" -M "${mailbody}"
}
report_update()

## Preserve adblock-lean files and config across OpenWrt upgrades

Just add the files:

```bash
/etc/init.d/adblock-lean
/usr/lib/adblock-lean/
/usr/lib/adblock-lean/abl-lib.sh
/usr/lib/adblock-lean/abl-process.sh
/etc/adblock-lean/
/etc/adblock-lean/config
/etc/adblock-lean/allowlist   # if used with your config
/etc/adblock-lean/blocklist   # if used with your config
/usr/libexec/abl_custom-script.sh   # if used with your config
```

to the list of files to backup in the Configuration tab in LuCi here:

http://openwrt.lan/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/flash

After completing sysupgrade, run the interactive setup again to re-enable adblock-lean:
`sh /etc/init.d/adblock-lean setup`. To preserve your old config, answer `e` when asked this question:
`Generate [n]ew config or use [e]xisting config?`


## adblock-lean version updates

adblock-lean automatically checks for version updates at the end of the `start` and `status` routines and prints a message if an update is available.

adblock-lean can be updated to the latest version by simply running:
```bash
service adblock-lean update
```

During certain updates, adblock-lean will require a configuration update. adblock-lean will detect any out-of-date configurations and prompt you to automatically update the config, using your existing settings where possible.

If automatic config update fails for any reason, a new compatible config can be generated, which will overwrite the previous config fie:
```bash
service adblock-lean gen_config
```

After updating adblock-lean, run the command:
```bash
service adblock-lean start
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall adblock-lean, run:
`service adblock-lean uninstall`
or
`sh /etc/init.d/adblock-lean uninstall`
